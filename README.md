Hello, I'm Sherif, a student at the Faculty of Computers and Information at Mansoura University. I have a strong foundation in programming, having learned languages like Python and C++. I also had the opportunity to participate in the ACPC (Arab Collegiate Programming Contest), where I gained valuable experience in problem-solving and teamwork. Recently, I started exploring the field of pentesting, as I am keen to expand my skills in cybersecurity.

I am passionate about learning and am always open to new challenges and opportunities in the field of computer science.

Skills:
* PYTHON
* OOP
* Data Structure
* Algorithm
* C++
